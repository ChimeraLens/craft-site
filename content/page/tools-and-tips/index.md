## Tools I use

- Craft Knife & Scissors: The main tools I use to cut out parts. I use my craft knife more than my scissors, as it's more comfortable for me.

- Craft Glue & Toothpicks: Typical tacky glue, and the toothpicks are useful for applying glue.

- Colored Markers: Used to color the edge of pieces, making the white edge less noticable on finished models.

- Tweezers: Used to handle the smaller parts, and to help apply pressure to glued parts.

- Paper: I use matte paper with 106gsm. It's sturdy enough for me and isn't too difficuit to fold.

- Copper Pellets: I sometimes use these to help models stand on their own. While they're useful, I try to design my models not to use these weights whenever possible.

## Assembling Tips

Some small tips that I've learned for making papercrafts.

- Only fold glue tabs to have a cleaner look to finished models.

- As mentioned before, color the edge of paper pieces with a colored marker before assembling to make the edge less noticable.

- For smaller parts, like hands for example, It's easier for me to cut off the glue tabs and to glue the edge instead. This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/papercraft/comments/10rmzld/tips_for_crafting_hands/) goes into more details.

- I use matte acrylic spray on my finished models to help lessen discoloring over time.
