I've always enjoyed making papercrafts as a hobby, so I wanted to try and create my own. I design all my models and release them for free online.

I only make papercrafts of Touhou and Terraria Characters so far, but I hope to continue branching out with more characters from other games and anime/manga.

This website will be used to display my works and to provide updates to whatever I'm working on. I may also upload other projects I work on.
