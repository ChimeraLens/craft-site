I'm currently working on two models:

## Stylist [Terraria]

![Front](stylist-wip1.png)  ![Back](stylist-wip2.png)  ![Right](stylist-wip3.png)  ![Left](stylist-wip4.png)

![With Apron](stylist-wip5.png)  ![Without Apron](stylist-wip6.png)

The template for the Stylist is almost done, I'm still making small adjustments. Once I'm done with that, I can start the assembly.

## Yuyuko Saigyouji [Touhou Project]

I have most of the textures done. I tried different designs on the kimono, but decided on keep the design simple with cherry blossoms.

I also need to model the hat and remaining textures. From there, I can make the pose and template.

I can't say for sure when I'll have these models compeleted.
