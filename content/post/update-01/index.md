I'm currently working on two models:

## Stylist [Terraria]

The template for the Stylist is almost done, just need to make some small adjustments and then assemble it.

## Yuyuko Saigyouji [Touhou Project]

I have most of the textures done. I tried different designs on the kimono, but decided on keep the design simple with cherry blossoms.

I also need to model the hat and remaining textures. From there, I can make the pose and template.

I can't say for sure when these models will be completed.
